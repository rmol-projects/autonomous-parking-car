##  Program Logic

1. The ultrasonic sensors detect distance to obstacles.
2. The STM32 processes sensor data to evaluate if a parking space is available.
3. When a suitable space is detected, it performs the parking maneuver autonomously.
4. Real-time control of the servo and motor is managed using timers and feedback from the encoder.
